                        <p>I'm Edvin, an undergraduate at UCLA studying applied mathematics with a focus in Machine
                            Learning
                            and its applications in multiple fields. I find great excitement in doing things that have
                            a high probability of failure. I find it to be the quickest path to a unique learning
                            experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>This website serves as my public journal, covering a spectrum of topics from technical writings to life-related reflections. While I firmly believe that going through physical pain is
                            the
                            premiere way of exploring your character, I've found writing to be as potent, if not
                            more,
                            in my journey of personal discovery.</p>

                        <!-- <p>There is no shortage of successful (but miserable) people in the world. I've come to realize
                            that
                            the best metric for success is not just a positive cash flow on your balance, but a mind at
                            peace,
                            and a life congruent with your values and beliefs.
                        </p> -->
