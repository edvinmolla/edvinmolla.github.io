            <h2>navigating waves</h2>
            <p>
life seems to be like a vast, scary ocean, where you can try as hard as you want to go from point A to point B, and its waves will quickly humble your ambition.
<br/><br/>
however, modern engineering has managed to reliably produce enormous ships that enable the global supply chain system, and they must be capable of navigating mother nature's inherent dangers. 
<br/><br/>
much like these ships, we tend to have a direction in life as well. life's waves and currents will often throw us off course, but the more momentum and inertia we have, the harder 
it will be for us to completely change direction. i like to think of momentum as demonstrated competence coupled with unwaverign dedication toward a certain goal. no matter what happens in life â€“ other than death, it will be difficult 
to throw a dedicated human off course.
<br/><br/>
by remaining vigilent and aware, one can maintain course and engine power, all the while waiting for the storm to pass and the waves to calm, and eventually continue in the desired course. 
hence, patience seems to be a virtue that pays off over the long term. 
<br/><br/>
this is a lesson i should repeat mroe often to myself, as patience seems to be an attribute whose power i repeteatedly underestimate, in my effort to bend nature to my will.
