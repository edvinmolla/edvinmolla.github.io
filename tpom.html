            Values are such an abstract concept. I sometimes think whether our ancestors, hundreds of thousands of years
            ago
            experienced such asbtract thoughts. Did they even need to? They must have been too busy surviving,
            protecting their children
            from bears, lions, and predators. They didn't have much free time on their hands to sit down and think about
            their values, much less
            do what I'm doing right now.

            <h4 style=" padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">~</h4>
            <div class="line"></div>

        <p style="font-family: tv;">
            However, values, morals, principles, and such entities are fascinating to thing about.
        How do they come about exactly? How do we learn and import values from our parents and society?
        How do we comform to society through exposure? What does this process look like?

   <br/><br/>

   I like to think of values as our operating system's protocols. It determines our perspective on new 
   and old information â€“ and how we handle it. Much like we use tcp/udp to understand how to handle packets, we use 
   values to understand how to handle new situations. It's evolution's way to cut corners and provide us
   with a framework to judge new situations.

   <br/><br/>
            If values are protocols for living life, then they can be subject to updating, right? If we move 
            to a new country, meet new people, experience a new culture, maybe that will affect our protocols.
            Maybe it changes our perspective on how to raise a child, or how to treat our body.

        <p>
            What if we don't have any values?<br/><br/>
            Well, I think that we cannot not have any values. One way or another, we will fill our brain 
            with information, be that the one we want or not.
